# field-biology-workflow

This is more of a rabbit hole attempt at structuring a process to be used by all consultants and contracted field biologists to use a collecting application and pipe that collected data into the correct databases for the usfws, azgfd, and other agencies.

1. Need to connect to a survey123 application {The idea is to give people a template by the head agencies for licensees and contractors to download and use}

2. Create a script that downloads the stored survey123 database to R and use simple coding data management to format the database into known formats for each respective agency.

3. Create outputs for the SCL app and .xlsx template and maybe usfws templates

4. Easily load those into the correct applications to be loaded into the respected databases.

* Another Idea is to create an rmarkdown template that exports the data into a awesome report!!
